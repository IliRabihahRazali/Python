Title: FoodHub Data Analysis using Python.
This is the first my Python project using Jupyter Notebook.  The foodhub company has stored their past online order data.  Now they need some recommendations and business insights
on how to increase their sales and what issue/sales/service area they need to improve.  Using Python, I helped them to analyzed univariate and bivariate analysis on their past data.
I am also using EDA to helped them identify which areas they need to improve.
